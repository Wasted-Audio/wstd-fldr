This is our wave folding effect plugin. It is very easy to use, with some basic controls.

It includes an automated limiter, that will try to keep things within the RMS level of your input signal.

Be careful with it as the output can potentially be very hot!

Like all our other software this plugin is without DRM and Opensource.
